## [0.2.1] - 2021-09-03
### Changed
- Changes the default CI build branch to `main`, and updates links in GUIDE.md
### Added
- Adds a "heads up" message to the top of the GUIDE.md indicating that you
  should check what version of the gem you are running before following the
  instructions.

## [0.2.0] - 2020-10-29
### Added
- This release adds a new `deprecate_attribute` helper! To get started, simply
  include `Uncruft::Deprecatable` in your class, and then supply an attribute
  name and deprecation message, like so: `deprecate_attribute :old_name,
  message: "Please stop using old_name"`. Note that this will deprecate both
  the getter and the setter. To apply this to just a single method, use
  `deprecate_method`.
- Special thanks to @yieldjessyield for the contribution!

## [0.1.0] - 2020-01-21
### Changed
- This release updates variable names and documentation to use more inclusive
  language. The ENV var for adding deprecations to the ignorefile is now
  `RECORD_DEPRECATIONS=1`.

## [0.0.2] - 2019-06-07
### Fixed
- Fixes an argument arity issue with `Kernal.warn` on newer rubies.

## [0.0.1] - 2019-04-30
### Added
- Initial open source commit! This gem has been used internally at Betterment
  for almost a year, and we've decided to open source it!
