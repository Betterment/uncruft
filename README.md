Uncruft
========

A library to assist with clearing out Rails deprecation warnings and upgrading Rails versions.

## Getting Started

Uncruft is designed to work with Rails 4.2 and higher.

### Installation

You can add Uncruft to your Gemfile with:

```
gem 'uncruft'
```

Then run `bundle install`.

### Deprecation Warnings

By default, deprecation warnings will cause your application to raise exceptions in `test` and `development` modes.

The exception message will include the original deprecation warning, plus a link to [our troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/Betterment/uncruft/blob/master/GUIDE.md), to assist with resolving deprecations as they are encountered.

## Recording Deprecations

When testing on a new Rails version for the first time, you will undoubtedly encounter many new warnings. As such, you can quickly record all existing deprecation warnings encountered during your test suite like so:

```bash
RECORD_DEPRECATIONS=1 rake
```

This will generate (or add to) an ignorefile of warnings at `config/deprecations.ignore`. Any warning in that file will be ignored when next encountered.

You can also incrementally add new warnings to the ignorefile as you encounter them:

```bash
RECORD_DEPRECATIONS=1 rspec path/to/my/failing/spec.rb
```

## How to Contribute

We would love for you to contribute! Anything that benefits the majority of users—from a documentation fix to an entirely new feature—is encouraged.
